# Neural_Networks_2
This is a work similar to the in maxxim333/Neural_Networks repository. This time, after cross-validation and creation of .rbf files, "sensitivity" parameter is calculated INDIVIDUALLY for each gene from a custom list of genes. This is done for both datasets and then a scatter plot is made to compare performance of each gene in each of the datasets.
